* Multiple Arbitrary Simultaneous Carets (MASC): Edit any number of text selections simultaneously. Use ⌥S to mark a selection (or the current caret location) and then ⌥F to convert all markers in to a snippet.([Duane Johnson](http://inquirylabs.com/))
* Refactor Selection with MASC: Select a portion of text you wish to refactorize, use ⌥D to mark all matching text in the document and then use ⌥F to convert all markers to a snippet. (Inherited from [Mario "kuroir" Ricalde](http://kuroir.com/))

## About this bundle

This is a TextMate Bundle to support some quick refactoring with the help of [Duane's Johnson Bundle](http://inquirylabs.com/blog2009/my-textmate-bundle/). Thanks to his incredible idea and amazing code. 80% of this code (or maybe way more) belongs to him.

Buy him a beer!
